# SMB3 Stat Calculator [![][wip]][smb3sc]
## Overview

This program is an unofficial stat/ranking calculator for Super Mega Baseball 3.
It allows you to take a player's real world stats and translate them directly into SMB3.

## Instructions

Enter in the players stats, and click "calculate". If the player is a pitcher, select the
"Pitcher" option. If you would like to add a modifier to the player's stats, simply change the
weight (min=0, default=1). For example if you wanted to reduce a player's speed, you could set
their speed weight to 0.6, and if you wanted to boost their power, you could set their power
weight to 1.8.

To get more information about each stat, go to `Help -> Guide` to see a legend containing all of them.

To check for updates, come back to this page and compare version numbers. The version number
can be found under the SMB3 Stat Calculator logo.

## Additional Information

Player stats are fixed, but player traits have an element of randomness to them.
If you would like a different set of traits, simply hit "calculate" again.

## Suggestions/Feedback

If you have any suggestions on how I can improve this application,
please let me know!
