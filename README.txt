-- Intro --

This program is an unofficial stat/ranking calculator for Super Mega Baseball 3.
You can take a player's real world stats and translate them directly into SMB3.

-- Info --

Player stats are fixed, but player traits have an element of randomness to them.
If you would like a different set of traits, simply hit "calculate" again.

-- Instructions --

Enter in the players stats, and click "calculate". If the player is a pitcher, select the
"Pitcher" option. If you would like to add a modifier to the player's stats, change the
weight for their respective stats (min=0, default=1). For example if you wanted to reduce
a player's speed, you could set their speed weight to 0.6, and if you wanted to boost thier
power, you could set their power weight to 1.8.
