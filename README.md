# SMB3-Stat-Calculator --WIP--
### -- Intro --

This program is an unofficial stat/ranking calculator for Super Mega Baseball 3.
You can take a player's real world stats and translate them directly into SMB3.

### -- Info --

Player stats are fixed, but player traits have an element of randomness to them.
If you would like a different set of traits, simply hit "calculate" again.

### -- Instructions --

Enter in the players stats, and click "calculate". If the player is a pitcher, select the
"Pitcher" option. If you would like to add a modifier to the player's stats, change the
weight for their respective stats (min=0, default=1). For example if you wanted to reduce
a player's speed, you could set their speed weight to 0.6, and if you wanted to boost thier
power, you could set their power weight to 1.8.

To get more information about each stat, go to `Help -> Guide` to see a legend containing all of them.

To check for updates, come back to this page and compare version numbers. The version number
can be found under the SMB3 Stat Calculator logo.
